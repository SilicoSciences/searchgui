            <a href="http://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html">PeptideShaker</a> can be used to process the search results 
            from multiple search engines and combine the identifications into a single result. For details on <b>PeptideShaker</b> 
            please the the <a href="http://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html">PeptideShaker home page</a>.
            <br><br>
            In order to use <a href="http://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html">PeptideShaker</a> from <b>SearchGUI</b> 
            you first have to download and unzip <b>PeptideShaker</b>. When this is done all you have to do is to click the 
            Edit button next to the <a href="http://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html">PeptideShaker</a> location field in this dialog 
            and locate the <a href="http://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html">PeptideShaker</a> jar file. You 
            only have to do this the first time you want to use <a href="http://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html">PeptideShaker</a>.
            <br><br>
            Next you provide some information about the project: project name, sample name and replicate number. These are 
            used for referring to the project at later stages of the analysis.
            <br><br>
            Finally you select the output file where you want the <a href="http://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html">PeptideShaker</a> results to be saved. Note that the results 
            will be automatically opened in <a href="http://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html">PeptideShaker</a> when the processing has completed.
            <br><br>
            You also have the opportunity of linking the <b>SearchGUI</b> results with <a href="www.matrixscience.com">Mascot</a> results. Note that the <a href="www.matrixscience.com">Mascot</a> results 
            have to be compatible with the <b>SearchGUI</b> results, i.e., the <a href="www.matrixscience.com">Mascot</a> searches have to be run the exact same spectrum 
            files and database, and with the same search settings. For details on how to carry out the <a href="www.matrixscience.com">Mascot</a> searches see 
            <a href="http://compomics.github.io/projects/peptide-shaker.html#mascot-support">Mascot Support</a> and 
            <a href="http://compomics.github.io/searchgui/wiki/databasehelp.html">Database Help</a>.
            <br><br>
            It is also possible to tailor the processing parameters and the import filters at this stage.
